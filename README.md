## 1.The Project

The project is about creating a responsive website using WordPress. Quotes on Dev is a website that generates random quotes from different authors. The website has a archive page where the user can find all the authors, categories and tags related to the quotes. Also in the "Submit a Quote" page the user is able to generate a quote (post) by filling out the form fields.

Following the project requirements and the RWD principles, three breakpoints for the website have been created:
<br>
- Mobile (375px)
- Tablet (620px)
- Desktop (1080px)
<br>

## 3.Personal Learnings

In this projects, I've learnt how to use WordPress and its installation processess in order to get the project started. With the WP template tags I managed to bring all the information needed through if else statements and while loops, where I had a better understanding of how to bring the content that I need to the righ webpage.
